## Project Overview:

This project focuses on **processing and analyzing house rent data** to uncover insights into property rental trends across different cities and property types.  
It involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the dataset to better understand the relationship between **rent amount**, **location**, **BHK type**, **furnishing status**, and other key variables.

The analysis helps property seekers, investors, and real estate analysts identify the major factors influencing rental prices.

---

## Objectives:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize column names.  
- **Data Transformation:** Convert categorical data into meaningful numerical values.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify trends and correlations in rental pricing.  
- **City-wise Comparison:** Understand which cities and property types have higher average rents.  
- **Visualization:** Create graphical insights for better interpretation of housing market trends.

## Dataset Information:

The dataset includes details about rental properties, such as:

- **Posted On** — Date when the property was listed  
- **BHK** — Number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens  
- **Rent** — Monthly rent amount (target variable)  
- **Size** — Total area of the property (in sq.ft.)  
- **Floor** — Floor number of the property  
- **Area Type** — Measurement unit (e.g., Super Area, Carpet Area)  
- **City** — City where the property is located  
- **Furnishing Status** — Type of furnishing (Furnished / Semi-Furnished / Unfurnished)  
- **Tenant Preferred** — Ideal tenant type (Family, Bachelor, Company)  
- **Bathroom** — Number of bathrooms  
- **Point of Contact** — Agent or owner contact info  

---

## Key Analysis and Insights:

- **Average Rent by City:** Identified which cities have higher median and mean rental rates.  
- **Impact of BHK and Size:** Analyzed how the number of rooms and area size affect rent.  
- **Furnishing Status Comparison:** Compared rents among furnished and unfurnished houses.  
- **Tenant Preferences:** Explored which tenant types are most preferred across cities.  
- **Correlation Study:** Examined how different numerical and categorical features influence rent.  

---

## Visualizations:

Some of the visualizations in the notebook include:

- Bar charts showing **average rent by city and furnishing type**  
- Box plots for **rent distribution based on BHK and area type**  
- Heatmaps highlighting **feature correlations**  
- Line plots for **rent trends over time (if timestamp data available)**  
- Scatter plots for **size vs. rent relationships**

## Run This Project:

**To Run this project you need a Jupyter Notebook in your system. also I uploaded a dataset file for the same first download it in your system & copy the path of dataset file & paste it in importing dataset column after pd.read_csv you have to paste the path of dataset file. after that you can run each & every cell to run it.**
